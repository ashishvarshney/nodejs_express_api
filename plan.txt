         > create a simple access token without expiry > problem: Life time access if stolen
        > Add expiry time > Problem: Bad UX
        > Introduce refresh token : Problem: This token also can be stolen, No way to revoke / delete that token
          One can generate unlimited access tokens using this refresh token
        > Make logout functionality and delete refresh token from database. Problem solved :)
